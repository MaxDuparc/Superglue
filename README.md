# $(2,2)$-Isogenies in the Theta Model with Superglue

This library provides both a [SageMath](https://www.sagemath.org) and a [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/com) implementation of $(2,2)$-isogenies in the theta model, where the gluing step is handled using the Superglue formulae, as detailed in the paper [Superglue: Fast formulae for (2,2)-gluing isogenies](https://eprint.iacr.org/2025/736).


Both implementations are built upon the implementation of $(2,2)$-isognies in the theta model by [Dartois–Maino–Pope–Robert](https://eprint.iacr.org/2023/1747), available [two-isogeny](https://github.com/ThetaIsogenies/two-isogenies).
